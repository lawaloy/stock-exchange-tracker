# Stock Projections Feature

## Overview

The Stock Projection system analyzes current market data and generates intelligent 5-day price projections with buy/sell/hold recommendations for all tracked stocks.

## Features

### 1. **Price Projections**

- **5-Day Price Targets**: Low, Mid, and High price targets
- **Expected Change**: Percentage gain/loss projection
- **Projection Date**: Target date for the projection

### 2. **Recommendations**

- **STRONG BUY**: High momentum bullish stocks with strong confidence
- **BUY**: Moderate bullish momentum
- **HOLD**: Neutral or unclear direction
- **SELL**: Moderate bearish pressure
- **STRONG SELL**: Strong bearish momentum, potential decline

### 3. **Confidence Scoring**

- **0-100% Confidence Score**: Based on multiple factors:
  - Momentum strength
  - Volatility levels
  - Trading volume
  - Market capitalization
  - Price stability

### 4. **Risk Assessment**

- **Low Risk**: Stable, low volatility stocks
- **Medium Risk**: Moderate volatility
- **High Risk**: High volatility, unpredictable

### 5. **Trend Classification**

- **Bullish**: Upward momentum expected
- **Bearish**: Downward pressure expected
- **Neutral**: Sideways movement expected

## How It Works

### Technical Analysis Components

1. **Momentum Score** (-100 to +100)
   - Calculated from recent price changes
   - Positive = Bullish, Negative = Bearish
   - Magnitude = Strength of trend

2. **Volatility Score** (0 to 100)
   - Measures price stability
   - Lower = More predictable
   - Higher = More risk/uncertainty

3. **Price Target Calculation**
   - Based on momentum direction
   - Adjusted for volatility range
   - Considers mean reversion for extreme moves

4. **Confidence Calculation**
   - Higher momentum = Higher confidence
   - Lower volatility = Higher confidence
   - High volume = Higher confidence
   - Large market cap = Higher confidence

### Recommendation Logic

```text
STRONG BUY:  Momentum > 40 AND Volatility < 60
BUY:         Momentum > 15
HOLD:        Momentum between -15 and +15
SELL:        Momentum < -15
STRONG SELL: Momentum < -40 AND Volatility < 60
```

## Usage

### Running the Tracker

The projection system is automatically integrated into the daily tracker:

```bash
# Run as normal - projections are included
python main.py

# Or via console script
stock-tracker
```

### Programmatic Access

```python
from src.workflows.tracker import StockTrackerWorkflow

# Run workflow
workflow = StockTrackerWorkflow()
result = workflow.run(use_screener=True)

if result['success']:
    # Access projections
    projections = result['projections']
    projection_summary = result['projection_summary']
    
    # Get specific stock projection
    aapl_projection = projections.get('AAPL')
    if aapl_projection:
        print(f"AAPL Target: ${aapl_projection['target_mid']:.2f}")
        print(f"Recommendation: {aapl_projection['recommendation']}")
        print(f"Confidence: {aapl_projection['confidence']}%")
```

### Custom Analysis

```python
from src.analysis.projector import StockProjector

# Initialize projector
projector = StockProjector()

# Generate projections for your data
current_stocks = [
    {'symbol': 'AAPL', 'close': 150.50, 'change_percent': 2.5, ...},
    # ... more stocks
]

projections = projector.generate_projections(current_stocks)
summary = projector.generate_projection_summary(projections)
```

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Stock projections are for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.**

- Projections are based on technical analysis of recent price action
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Markets are influenced by many unpredictable factors
- Always do your own research and consult with financial advisors
- Consider multiple sources before making investment decisions

### Limitations

1. **Short-term focus**: 5-day projections only
2. **Technical only**: No fundamental analysis (earnings, news, etc.)
3. **Historical data**: Requires at least 1 day of data
4. **No guarantees**: Market conditions can change rapidly

### Best Practices

✅ **Use as one input among many**
✅ **Compare with other analysis tools**
✅ **Monitor confidence scores**
✅ **Consider risk levels**
✅ **Track accuracy over time**
✅ **Adjust for market conditions**

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

- [ ] Multi-timeframe projections (1-day, 5-day, 30-day)
- [ ] Historical accuracy tracking
- [ ] Machine learning model integration
- [ ] Fundamental analysis factors
- [ ] News sentiment integration
- [ ] Sector correlation analysis
- [ ] Backtesting framework
- [ ] Alert system for high-confidence opportunities
