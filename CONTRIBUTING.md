# Contributing to Stock Exchange Tracker

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stock-exchange-tracker.git
   cd stock-exchange-tracker
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install in development mode**:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   pip install pytest pytest-cov  # For testing
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code structure
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_core_config.py -v
```

### 4. Check Code Quality

```bash
# Format code (optional, but recommended)
pip install black isort
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/

# Lint code (optional)
pip install flake8
flake8 src/ tests/ --max-line-length=100
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature X"
# or
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with Y"
```

**Commit Message Guidelines:**

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- Clear description of changes
- Reference to any related issues
- Screenshots (if UI changes)

## Code Structure

```text
src/
├── core/          # Core utilities (config, logging)
├── services/      # External data services (API, fetchers)
├── analysis/      # Data analysis & AI
├── storage/       # Data persistence
├── workflows/     # Business logic (reusable across interfaces)
└── cli/           # CLI interface (presentation layer)
```

**Key Principle**: Business logic in `workflows/` is reusable.
CLI/Web/API layers consume workflows for their specific presentation needs.

## Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable names

### Imports

```python
# Standard library
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Third-party
import pandas as pd
import requests

# Local
from ..core.logger import setup_logger
from .api_client import FinnhubClient
```

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def function_name(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description of function.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2
    
    Returns:
        Description of return value
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: When something goes wrong
    """
    pass
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use descriptive test names:

```python
def test_function_returns_expected_value_when_given_valid_input(self):
    """Test that function returns correct value with valid input."""
    # Arrange
    input_data = create_test_data()
    
    # Act
    result = function_under_test(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    self.assertEqual(result, expected_value)
```

## Areas for Contribution

### High Priority - New Features

- [ ] **Alert & Notification System** (CRITICAL FOR BUYING DECISIONS)
  - Price alerts (threshold-based: "alert me when AAPL < $150")
  - Screening alerts (pattern-based: "alert when high volume + big gain")
  - Custom conditions (RSI, moving average crossovers)
  - Multiple notification channels:
    - AWS SNS, Azure Service Bus or Event Grid etc. (SMS, email)
    - Email (SMTP)
    - Webhook (Slack, Discord, custom)
    - Push notifications (optional)
  - Alert history and management
  - Configurable alert rules in JSON/YAML

- [ ] **Support for additional stock exchanges** (international markets: LSE, TSE, HKEX)
- [ ] **More screening filters** (technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving averages)
- [ ] **Enhanced AI summaries** (sentiment analysis, news integration, buy/sell recommendations)
- [ ] **Data visualization features** (charts, graphs, trends, heatmaps)
- [ ] **Historical data analysis** (backtesting strategies, trend analysis, performance metrics)
- [ ] **Web dashboard** (interactive UI for viewing results and managing alerts)

### Medium Priority - Improvements

- [ ] Additional unit tests (especially for services/)
- [ ] Integration tests for full workflow
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] CLI improvements (progress bars, colors, interactive mode)

### Low Priority - Enhancements

- [ ] Configuration validation with detailed error messages
- [ ] Additional export formats (Excel, Parquet)
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and recovery
